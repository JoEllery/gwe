# Harvard GWE Website

This repo hosts the source files for the Harvard GWE website. 

This website was built using the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package. We use the [Hyde Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/) and emulate some styling from [Sam Crane's website](https://github.com/samuelcrane/samuelcrane.com). It is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

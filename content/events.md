**We have postponed all our in-person events from March 2020 onwards due to COVID-19.** 

While we are apart physically, we are continuing to build community and support each other with weekly virtual lunches ("Littauer Ladies who Lunch") and co-working times. [Contact us](/get-involved/) if you'd like to join virtual meetings.

To foster solidarity across Harvard programs, the Kennedy PhD Student Association (KPSA), Graduate Women in Economics (GWE), Government GSA Diversity Committee, and HGSE Women in Education Policy & Program Evaluation are hosting a cross-department happy hour for all women^[This term includes anyone who identifies with the experience of living as a woman.] in policy-related PhD programs. 

Help us celebrate the end of the semester with snacks and drinks courtesy of HKS! We'll be at **John Harvard's next Thursday May 16th from 5-7 pm.** Please RSVP [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftMf8lvoqQ8Dbf-K59YDtr8RgS9lL3qiMue8BUAPsBbaVwrw/viewform) to give us a sense of headcount. 

Hope to see you there!

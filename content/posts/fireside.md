Across the Economics Department, our faculty have a range of backgrounds and research specialties. At the same time, the Department--and the economics profession broadly--are still working to address longstanding problems with diversity and representation. Please join us for a conversation with four faculty members from the Department for a chat about their varied paths and approaches to economics.


All graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to attend and bring questions!  The discussion will be moderated by LJ Ristovska from Graduate Women in Economics (GWE) and Bonnie Liu from Harvard Undergraduates for Inclusion in Economics (HUIE).

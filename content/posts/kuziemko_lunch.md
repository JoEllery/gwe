From [Prof Kuziemko's website](https://chw.princeton.edu/people/ilyana-kuziemko),

> Ilyana Kuziemko is an economist who focuses on economic inequality.  Her current interest is on how voters form preferences over redistributive policies.  From 2009-2010, she took a public service leave to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Treasury.  She worked primarily on the development and early implementation of the Affordable Care Act and has since published research on U.S. public health insurance programs, and in particular how they serve at-risk populations.  A final area of interest is the U.S. criminal justice system.  A.B., Economics, Harvard, B.A., Mathematics, Oxford; PhD., Economics, Harvard.

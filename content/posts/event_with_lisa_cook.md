## Event Information

Grad Women in Econ is extremely excited to host **a conversation with Dr. Lisa Cook Friday October 26th, 1:30-2:30pm**, in Littauer 3rd floor lounge (over tea and cookies)! **All are welcome.** 

This will be a great opportunity to learn more about diversity and inclusion in our profession, so come with thoughts and questions. Dr. Cook has deep wisdom and expertise on these topics as someone at the heart of the profession's efforts. We are particularly excited to have her here since her presentation was one of the highlights of the [Berkeley summit on diversity in economics](http://calwomenofecon.weebly.com/summit-for-diversity-in-economics.html) last month!

They were put together by [Shelly Lundberg](https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/shelly-lundberg-ph.d), who's the current Chair of the [AEA Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/cswep).

- Dr. Cook mentioned [DivEQ](http://diversifyingecon.org/index.php/Main_Page) in connection with Innessa's question on teaching. They're a great resource promoting inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based teaching practices in economics.

- [AEA Committee on Equity, Diversity and Professional Conduct](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/equity-diversity-professional-conduct): Dr Cook is one of the members of this very new AEA committee.

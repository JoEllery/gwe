To expand access to the amazing female economists coming through Harvard, Grad Women in Econ has organized small group lunch meetings with the female presenters at the Social Policy and Economics seminar at HKS.

This event: **lunch with Teodora Boneva on 3/24/20!**

The lunches are held in Taubman 457 at HKS from 1-2 pm, directly after the presenter's talk in Rubenstein 414 from 12-1. You can grab lunch from the seminar and bring it to the meeting room to eat with the speaker.

If you'd like to join, please reach out to Isabel Harbaugh Macdonald (`iharbaugh@g.harvard.edu`).

> My research fields are Labor Economics and Behavioral Economics. In my current research, I investigate the role of beliefs in educational investment decisions and the role of educational interventions in fostering skills in childhood. I collect novel data and use a variety of different research methods such as field experiments and survey-based techniques to understand how we can promote skill acquisition and narrow socioeconomic and gender gaps in educational and labor market outcomes.

**UPDATE: This lunch is at maximum capacity -- check back for similar events next spring!** 

Many people attended the faculty panels last semester hosted by Grad Women in Econ, and enjoyed getting perspective from female economists on their careers and gender in the profession. In order to continue these conversations, GWE has arranged for small-group lunch meetings with the awesome female presenters at the new Economics of Social Policy seminar at HKS. The second is with [Professor Rebecca Diamond](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/rebecca-diamond).

From Professor Diamond's website,

> Rebecca Diamond is an applied micro economist studying local labor and housing markets. Her recent research focuses on the causes and consequences of diverging economic growth across U.S. cities and its effects on inequality.

> Rebecca Diamond is an Associate Professor of Economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business where she teaches Data and Decisions. Her current research studies the causes and consequence of segregation of households by income and education level across neighborhoods and labor markets. She was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research from 2013 to 2014. She received her PhD in Economics from Harvard University in 2013 and her BS in Physics and Economics and Mathematics from Yale University in 2007.

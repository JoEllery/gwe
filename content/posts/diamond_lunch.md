Many people attended the faculty panels last semester hosted by Grad Women in Econ, and enjoyed getting perspective from female economists on their careers and gender in the profession. In order to continue these conversations, GWE has arranged for small-group lunch meetings with the awesome female presenters at the new Economics of Social Policy seminar at HKS. The second is with [Professor Rebecca Diamond](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/rebecca-diamond).

**This lunch is at maximum capacity -- check back for similar events next spring!** 

- What: **Lunch with Professor Rebecca Diamond**
- When: **Tuesday November 5th, 1pm-2pm**
- Where: **Rubenstein 414 at HKS**

You can also attend the speaker's research presentation from 12pm-1pm in the same room. The meetings will be casual, but please come prepared with a question or two to ask the speaker.

Finally, if you'd like to help arrange similar meetings with presenters at your own favorite seminar, please reach out to Isabel (`iharbaugh@g.harvard.edu`) to discuss!

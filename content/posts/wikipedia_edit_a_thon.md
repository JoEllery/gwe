### Calling all budding Wikipedia editors (of all genders) for... **the GWE Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon!**

![](/posts/wikipedia_edit_a_thon_files/wiki_edits.jpg)

11 of 13 "notable economists" and both pictures on Wikipedia's ["Economist"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist) page are men. Donna Strickland, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics last year, [didn't have a Wikipedia page](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/03/donna-strickland-nobel-physics-prize-wikipedia-denied). 18% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women. 87% of Wikipedia editors are men. 

Bring your laptop to **Littauer M42 4-5pm Thursday April 18th** to help change the image of what an economist looks like online, and help top women economists get the recognition they deserve! 

No need for any prior Wikipedia editing experience, or any idea of what you'll write. We will provide a list of women who don't have bios at all or have stub bios that need expanding - as well as fun snacks. Plus, if you stay until 5pm you can greet the therapy dogs too...!

Why do this? Lots more details in [this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05947-8).^[This event is inspired by 500 Women Scientists' Edit-A-Thon.]

### Want to do this on your own time? Some ideas:

1. Pick your favourite women economists and go add detail on their work to their pages
2. Go to topic pages, see if there is relevant work by women economists which isn't linked so far, and add it 
    - Start with [this list of important publications in economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_economics)
3. Write a new bio for women economists with no bio at all 
    - Project Women In Red maintains [a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Missing_articles_by_occupation/Economists)
4. Expand on stub articles (articles without much detail)
    - A list of economist stubs [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Economist_stubs)
5. Translate existing Wikipedia bios into other languages

Bring your laptop to **Littauer M42 4-5pm Thursday April 18th** to help change the image of what an economist looks like online, and help top women economists get the recognition they deserve! 

No need for any prior Wikipedia editing experience, or any idea of what you'll write. We will provide a list of women who don't have bios at all or have stub bios that need expanding - as well as fun snacks. Plus, if you stay until 5pm you can greet the therapy dogs too...!

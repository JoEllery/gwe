Prospective Harvard PhD students will be visiting the economics department April 1-2 for "visit days"!
Harvard Visit days are packed with meetings with Professors and students, in which people discuss anything from research interests to Cambridge housing. GWE and the diversity and inclusion group are hosting a coffee hour for women and members of minority groups on Monday **April 1 5:00â€“6:00pm in the Littauer Hanson-Mason room**.

We'll be mingling and enjoying light refreshments, so please feel free to drop by even if you can't stay for the full hour.

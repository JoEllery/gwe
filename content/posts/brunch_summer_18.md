The wonderful LJ Ristovska is hosting a women's brunch at her house on Saturday, December 1st, at 12pm. It will be a wonderful opportunity for the grad women to get to know each other and/or catch up over some food and drinks! 

There will be mimosas and bagels (courtesy of the Economics Department) and LJ will provide some additional food.

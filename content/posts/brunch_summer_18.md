The Grad Women in Econ group would like to announce our inaugural event! We will be hosting a women's brunch at Anna's house on **Sunday, April 8 at 12pm.** 

This will be a casual get-together, and we hope it will be a chance for grad women in the department to get to know each other better. We will provide bagels & mimosas. Please RSVP to annastansbury@g.harvard.edu and bring something to share!

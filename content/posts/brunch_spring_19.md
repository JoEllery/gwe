The G1's are almost done with their first year of the PhD program! In celebration of their ongoing quest for micro/macro/metrics knowledge, Ambra is hosting a women's brunch with the G1's at her house on **April 7th at 11am**. 

This will be a great opportunity for female grad students of all G-years to meet the female G1s if you haven't already! Please RSVP to aseck@g.harvard.edu.

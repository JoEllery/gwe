## About Katie Coffman

Quoting from [her HBS page](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=879706&facInfo=res),

> Katherine Coffman is an assistant professor of business administration in the Negotiations, Organizations & Markets unit. Before joining HBS, she was an assistant professor of economics at The Ohio State University and a visiting assistant professor of economics at Stanford University.

> Professor Coffman studies the dynamics of decision making by individuals and groups, and particularly how gender differences affect outcomes in economically significant contexts. Recognizing that innovative ideas and good answers are valuable only if they are put forward, Professor Coffman employs controlled laboratory settings to investigate the factors that predict whether a person will decide to volunteer ideas, and to measure the effect of these decisions on outcomes. Ultimately, her research can help organizations redesign processes to enhance the contributions of all participants.

> In her research, Professor Coffman has investigated the intersection of gender and decision making in a number of situations. In a randomized experiment involving groups of two, she found that individuals are much less willing to contribute ideas in areas that are stereotypically outside of their genderâ€™s domain. The results of another experiment demonstrate that women are more likely than men to skip questions on multiple-choice tests when they are unsure of the answer, a decision that has a significant negative effect on their test scores. She has complemented such experiments with theoretical work on stereotype formation.

> Professor Coffman is now exploring the role of gender in labor-market contexts, such as employment interviews, negotiations, and promotion decisions.

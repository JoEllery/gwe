This event will feature a stellar line up of Job Market Candidates with Job Market Papers (JMPs) on outcomes by gender across a range of contexts, from the ask gap to unemployment insurance:

For the first half of this event, each researcher will discuss their JMP context + results. For the second half, we will shift to Q+A and broad discussion questions. [Alex Albright](https://scholar.harvard.edu/apalbright) and [Steph Kestelman](https://skestelman.github.io/) will moderate with questions from the audience. Audience members can submit questions via the Zoom chat during the event or via [this form](https://forms.gle/rMLJnaj55e6ySSuY7) before the event.

There will also be a 30 min *gather.town* hang afterwards for any attendees and panelists who are interested in continuing the conversation. We will share that link at the end of the webinar.

The GWE is excited to invite you to the first event in our faculty speaker series: **A Conversation with Female Faculty in Economics.** The event will take place on **March 1st from 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm in Littauer M16.** 

![](/posts/creating-a-new-theme_files/convo_event1.png)

A panel comprised of [Emily Breza](https://sites.google.com/view/ebreza/home), [Melissa Dell](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dell/home), [Karen Dynan](https://scholar.harvard.edu/kdynan/home), and [Amanda Pallais](https://scholar.harvard.edu/pallais/home) will be discussing their careers and the impacts gender has had on the profession. Please come with comments and questions as there will be time at the end of the event to take questions from the audience. Refreshments will be provided. Everyone, of all genders, with interest in the topic is welcome to attend.

If you are interested and cannot attend, do not fear, there will be another female faculty panel event on April 5th with additional faculty. More information to follow. This is also the first of an ongoing speaker series which we hope to expand to include both male and female faculty members from Econ, HKS, HBS, and other related departments.

Join us for an informal conversation with Dr. Owen Zidar next Wednesday! We will chat about research, career advice and his perspective on how to advance diversity and inclusion issues in economics. We’ll leave time for networking — as Owen said, he wants this event to give people a chance to know they will have *“a friendly face in Princeton interviews / conferences in the future, or just someone they can ask questions.”*  Coffee and light (pre-lunch) snacks provided. **Please bring questions!**

[Owen Zidar](https://scholar.princeton.edu/zidar) is an Associate Professor of Economics and Public Affairs in the Princeton University Department of Economics and Woodrow Wilson School. He is also a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Professor Zidar is a public finance economist who studies the [taxation of firms and top earners, local fiscal policy, and the creation and distribution of economic resources](https://scholar.princeton.edu/zidar/publications). Before joining Princeton, Zidar worked as an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers, and as an analyst at Bain Capital Ventures. This January, Zidar will join the editorial board of the Journal of Public Economics as co-editor.  He is also [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/omzidar). 

**Please RSVP to Steph (`skestelman@g.harvard.edu`) so we roughly know how many to expect!**^[If you didn't RSVP you can still come, we just want a rough idea of numbers.]

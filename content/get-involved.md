## Come along to our events!

We hold events throughout the semester, including roundtable and panel discussions, brunches and happy hours, and one-offs like our Halloween movie night or our Wikipedia Edit-a-thon. We post about upcoming events on our listserv, [our twitter](https://twitter.com/HarvardGWE), and on this website.

If you're a grad student in economics at Harvard, we'd love you to be involved with our group. All genders welcome to join the mailing list and core team and to come to most of our events -- we'll be explicit if there's any event just for women.

## Join our Mailing List

Email `harvardgwe@gmail.com` to join our listserv, where we publicize our events and other things relating to gender in economics.

## Come along to our events!

We hold events throughout the semester, including roundtable and panel discussions, brunches and happy hours, and one-offs like our Halloween movie night or our Wikipedia Edit-a-thon. We post about upcoming events on our listserv, [our twitter](https://twitter.com/HarvardGWE), and on this website.

## Join the Core Team

If you’re interested in helping plan events, or in working on projects to do with gender in economics/in our department, we’d love to have you join us on the core team! The core team meets monthly. Email `harvardgwe@gmail.com` for more info.
